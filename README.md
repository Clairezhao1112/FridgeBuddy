# [FridgeBuddy]
## Problem Statement
I often find myself staring at my fridge wondering what I can cook with random ingredients I have on hand. Instead of letting food go to waste or ordering takeout unnecessarily, I wanted a quick way to discover recipes based on what's already in my kitchen and my current mood. This saves money, reduces food waste, and makes meal planning effortless.

## Solution
FridgeBuddy is a React web application that takes your available ingredients and instantly suggests recipes you can make. It also includes "mood filters" to match recipes to how you're feeling. Whether you want something quick (Lazy mode), budget-friendly (Broke mode), healthy (Healthy mode), comforting (Comfort mode), or trying something new (Adventurous mode).

## API Used
- **API Name**: Spoonacular Food API
- **API Documentation**: https://spoonacular.com/food-api/docs
- **How it's used**: The app uses the "Find by Ingredients" endpoint to search for recipes that match the user's available ingredients. It returns recipe suggestions with information about how many ingredients the user already has and how many they'd need to buy.
